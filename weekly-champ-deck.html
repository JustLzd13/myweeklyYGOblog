        <h1>Player: Yansi Chiong</h1>
        <h2>November 10, 2024 - Champion Decklist</h2>
        <p>This guy works in Zamboanga City Water District. Therefore, He is obliged
            to play with water decks for the rest of his life. This materiactor is kind
            of new to the scene in our community therefore many do not have red the effects
            of this abomination therefore no one can know where to negate or stop this new
            deck. Bringing new fresh deck is an advantage with this deck, it recycles material
            and by recycling material and returning material from hand it can also add material from deck to his
            xyz monster or even from hand. Allowing him to do combos along with the XYZ monster of 
            the materiactor and it such a pain card to deal with.
