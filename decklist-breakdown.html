        <h2>Jhonathan's Reign is never ending!!! - This week deck spotlight is MIKANKO ARGOSTAR</h2>
        <p>Another win for this man's Mikanko but this time it is mixed with the new archetype Argostar from Supreme Darkness(SUDA)</p>
        <p>
            This man craftiness on building new build together with mikanko is endless. 
            From pure to Dogmatika, to Argostar this man got it all. Defeating every feat and outwitting oponents with his
            101% Yu-Gi-Oh game IQ.
    
            Argostar adds addition negate and disruption aside from mikanko's stand alone
            power and being untargetable this man made it possible to evade non targeting 
            effects by adding negation to his turn 1 board. As for his go 2nd board,
            he completely changes build into board wiping and handtrap build of his mikanko.
